Contact us: http://les-epicuriens-du-logiciel.ca\r\n\r\n### Contact information\r\n* Carl Letourneau, [@cletourneau](http://twitter.com/cletourneau), [codesimple.ca](http://codesimple.ca)\r\n* Eric Mignot, [@ericminio](http://twitter.com/ericminio), [ericminio.com](http://ericminio.com)\r\n* François Perron, [@fperron](http://twitter.com/fperron), [happydev.ca](http://happydev.ca)\r\n\r\n### Bio\r\nCarl likes to learn. A new problem is for him a new opportunity to explore new things, new technologies, staying pragmatic by focusing on helping people around him. He is a Swiss army knife full-featured with languages and development tools.\r\n\r\nEric's goal is to have fun in the software development industry. His best tools so far are Scrum, TDD and the Core Protocols. He delivers the best results when using them all together. Eric likes to write code, to share the techniques that work for him, to build and deliver simple software that make a difference in the daily-life of their users. Eric is a Prof. Scrum Trainer licensed by [scrum.org](http://scrum.org).\r\n\r\nFrançois has been surfing in the software development industry for 13 years. He played different roles and among them developer, tech lead, team lead, Scrum Master, agile coach and director. He specifically focuses on Clean Code, SOLID and XP practices in general. Now, with The Software Epicureans he likes to build simple softwares that help people in their daily life.\r\n\r\n### Speaking experience\r\n\r\nWe're regular speakers at agile conferences. We have presented during previous edition of the Agile Tour in Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, Toronto, Paris.\r\n\r\n### Session's title\r\n\r\nReady, set, code!\r\n\r\n### Who is the intended audience ?\r\n\r\nAnyone interested in software development\r\n\r\n### What will they take away from this session ?\r\n\r\nNew ideas to use and take advantage of test-driven development.\r\n\r\nNew ideas to include coding-katas in their continuous learning process.\r\n\r\nA renewed passion for refactoring and outside-in test-driven development.\r\n\r\n### Expected duration\r\n\r\n50 mn.\r\n\r\n### Session description\r\n\r\nDuring this session, you'll see software development. Two developments in parallel will take place and will be decoded for you : the process, the tools, the techniques. Several key moments will be highlighted that will help to point out the differences between the two presenters and will give room for interactive discussions on typical debates:\r\n* When do you stop refactoring?\r\n* How do you choose your next test when using tdd?\r\n* How to balance readability and language optimization?\r\n* How to choose between to implementation of a same business need?\r\n\r\n### The language in which you would like to speak\r\n\r\nEnglish\r\n\r\n### Feel free to supply any additional content that you feel may help convey why we should pick your proposal\r\n\r\nAs regular speakers and attendees of agile conferences, we think that those conferences lack of technical content. We are glad to offer life coding during your conference to share what works for us and contribute to keep these conferences a hand-on event where slides are not the first-class citizens.\r\n\r\nWe're not here to give lessons. We're to share what works for us and learn from the audience. We hope that what we share will be challenged by the audience and hopefully some attendee will stand up and propose alternative paths that we will explore live. This is a live interactive coding-dojo where the audience can take the lead.\r\n\r\nWe gave this session in June in Montreal (http://agilemontreal.ca/events/a-vos-marques-prets-codez/). Feel free to contact the Agile Montreal group and get their feedback.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
